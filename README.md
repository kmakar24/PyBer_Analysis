# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
We are now going to futher our analysis of the ride sharing platform PyBer. We are going to look at the data by each city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 
## Results 
As seen by the image below there were a few things to take away from merging the two data sets and creating the summary data frame by city type. 

1. Urban is where over 50% of all the rides come from, and have the most amount of drivers and revenue. Since there may be more competition due to the amount of drivers exceeding the amount of rides may be why the average price per ride and per driver is significantly cheaper. 
2. Where rural and suburban has more rides than drivers so the drivers can charge more because they have the advantage.

## Summary 
- More poeple uber in urban cities because they either do not have a car and usually walk or are visiting there and did not rent a car. Also things in a city is closer together so easy to pick up a person near you. 
- Rural and Suburban areas are more spread out and usually the main reason people need a driver in those areas is so they do not drink and drive so there are not as many drivers in those type of areas because they probably can get more rides in a city.
